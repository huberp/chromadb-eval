## Vectors

A vector is an ordered list of numbers. Vectors can represent points in space, directions, or abstract data. Vector operations include addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product. The dot product of vectors a and b is a·b = |a||b|cos(θ), where θ is the angle between them.
