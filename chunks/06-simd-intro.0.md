# Introduction to SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)

SIMD stands for Single Instruction Multiple Data, a parallel computing architecture that enables a single instruction to process multiple data elements simultaneously. This technique is fundamental to modern computing performance, especially in multimedia, scientific computing, and machine learning applications.
