## Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices can represent linear transformations, systems of equations, or data. Matrix operations include addition, multiplication, and finding the determinant and inverse. Matrix multiplication is not commutative: AB ≠ BA in general.
