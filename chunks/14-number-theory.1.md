## Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers.
