## How SIMD Works

In traditional scalar processing, one instruction operates on one data element at a time. SIMD, however, allows one instruction to operate on multiple data elements in parallel. For example, instead of adding four pairs of numbers sequentially, SIMD can add all four pairs simultaneously using a single instruction.
