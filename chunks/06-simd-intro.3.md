## SIMD Instruction Sets

Modern processors include various SIMD instruction sets:

- **SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions)**: Intel's first mainstream SIMD instruction set
- **AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)**: Extends SSE with wider 256-bit registers
- **AVX-512**: Further extends to 512-bit registers
- **ARM NEON**: ARM architecture's SIMD technology
- **AltiVec**: Used in PowerPC processors
