# Geometry: The Study of Shapes and Space

Geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the properties and relationships of points, lines, surfaces, and solids.

## Euclidean Geometry

Euclidean geometry, based on Euclid's axioms, deals with flat space. Key concepts include points (no dimension), lines (one dimension), planes (two dimensions), and solids (three dimensions).

## Angles and Triangles

Angles are measured in degrees or radians. Triangles are classified by sides (equilateral, isosceles, scalene) or angles (acute, right, obtuse). The sum of angles in a triangle always equals 180 degrees.

## Pythagorean Theorem

In a right triangle, a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. This fundamental theorem has countless applications in mathematics and physics.
