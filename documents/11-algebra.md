# Algebra: The Foundation of Mathematics

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. It forms the foundation for advanced mathematics and is essential in science, engineering, and everyday problem-solving.

## Basic Concepts

Variables are symbols that represent unknown or changing values. Constants are fixed values that don't change. Expressions combine variables, constants, and operations. Equations state that two expressions are equal.

## Operations

The fundamental operations in algebra include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations follow specific rules like the commutative property (a + b = b + a), associative property ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)), and distributive property (a(b + c) = ab + ac).

## Linear Equations

Linear equations are equations where variables appear only to the first power. The general form is ax + b = c. Solving linear equations involves isolating the variable using inverse operations.

## Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations contain variables raised to the second power. The standard form is ax² + bx + c = 0. Solutions can be found using factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a.
