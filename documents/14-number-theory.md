# Number Theory: The Study of Integers

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted to the study of integers and integer-valued functions. It's one of the oldest and most fundamental areas of mathematics.

## Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers.

## Divisibility

An integer a is divisible by integer b if there exists an integer k such that a = kb. The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both. The Euclidean algorithm efficiently computes the GCD.

## Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic deals with remainders. We write a ≡ b (mod m) if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m. This concept is crucial in cryptography and computer science.
