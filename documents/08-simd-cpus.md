# SIMD in Modern CPUs

Modern CPUs have evolved to include increasingly sophisticated SIMD capabilities. Understanding these features helps developers write optimized code.

## Intel Processors

Intel introduced MMX in 1996, followed by SSE in 1999. SSE evolved through several versions (SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4). AVX arrived in 2011 with Sandy Bridge, AVX2 in 2013 with Haswell, and AVX-512 in 2015 with Xeon Phi.

## AMD Processors

AMD processors support similar instruction sets to Intel, implementing SSE, AVX, and AVX2. Recent AMD chips also support AVX-512 in their Zen 4 architecture.

## ARM Processors

ARM's NEON technology provides SIMD capabilities for ARM processors, widely used in mobile devices and increasingly in servers with ARM server chips.
