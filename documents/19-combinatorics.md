# Combinatorics: Counting and Arrangements

Combinatorics is the mathematics of counting, arrangements, and combinations. It has applications in computer science, probability, and optimization.

## Permutations

A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n! (n factorial). For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

## Combinations

A combination is a selection of objects without regard to order. The number of ways to choose k objects from n is given by the binomial coefficient: C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).

## Pigeonhole Principle

If n items are placed into m containers with n > m, at least one container must contain more than one item. This simple principle has powerful applications.
