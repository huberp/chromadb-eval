# Trigonometry: The Mathematics of Triangles and Circles

Trigonometry studies relationships between angles and sides of triangles, and extends to model periodic phenomena.

## Basic Trigonometric Functions

The sine, cosine, and tangent functions are defined using right triangles:
- sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse
- cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse  
- tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent = sin(θ)/cos(θ)

## Unit Circle

The unit circle provides a way to extend trigonometric functions to all angles. On a circle of radius 1, any point is (cos(θ), sin(θ)) where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis.

## Identities

Key trigonometric identities include the Pythagorean identity: sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1. Angle sum formulas allow computing trig functions of combined angles.
