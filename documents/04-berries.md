# Berries: Nature's Antioxidant Gems

Berries are small, pulpy, and often edible fruits. True berries develop from a single flower with one ovary. This category includes strawberries (technically not true berries), blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries.

## Antioxidant Power

Berries are loaded with antioxidants, particularly anthocyanins, which give them their vibrant colors. These compounds help protect cells from damage and reduce inflammation.

## Varieties

Blueberries are rich in anthocyanins and have been linked to improved brain function. Strawberries contain more vitamin C than oranges by weight. Raspberries are high in fiber and have a low glycemic index. Blackberries contain high levels of vitamin K and manganese.
