# Set Theory: The Foundation of Modern Mathematics

Set theory provides the foundation for modern mathematics. A set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements or members.

## Basic Concepts

Sets can be finite or infinite. The empty set ∅ contains no elements. Common sets include natural numbers ℕ, integers ℤ, rational numbers ℚ, and real numbers ℝ.

## Operations

Union (A ∪ B) combines elements from both sets. Intersection (A ∩ B) contains elements in both sets. Difference (A - B) contains elements in A but not in B. Complement (A') contains elements not in A.

## Relations and Functions

A relation is a set of ordered pairs. A function is a special relation where each input has exactly one output. Functions are fundamental to all of mathematics.
