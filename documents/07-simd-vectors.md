# SIMD Vector Operations

Vector operations are the core of SIMD programming. A vector in SIMD context refers to a collection of data elements that can be processed together.

## Vector Registers

SIMD architectures use special vector registers to hold multiple data elements. For instance, a 256-bit AVX register can hold:
- 8 single-precision floats
- 4 double-precision floats
- 32 8-bit integers
- 16 16-bit integers
- 8 32-bit integers

## Basic Operations

Common SIMD operations include arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide), logical operations (AND, OR, XOR), comparisons, and data movement operations like load, store, shuffle, and blend.
