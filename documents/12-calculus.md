# Calculus: The Mathematics of Change

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It has two main branches: differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes) and integral calculus (concerning accumulation and areas).

## Limits

The concept of a limit is fundamental to calculus. A limit describes the value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value. Formally, lim(x→a) f(x) = L means that f(x) gets arbitrarily close to L as x approaches a.

## Derivatives

The derivative measures the rate of change of a function. If y = f(x), the derivative dy/dx or f'(x) represents the instantaneous rate of change. Geometrically, it's the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph.

## Integrals

Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. The definite integral ∫[a,b] f(x)dx represents the area under the curve f(x) from x = a to x = b. The indefinite integral ∫f(x)dx represents the family of antiderivatives.
