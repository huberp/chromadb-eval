# Graph Theory: Networks and Connections

Graph theory studies graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph consists of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links).

## Types of Graphs

Undirected graphs have edges with no direction. Directed graphs (digraphs) have edges with direction. Weighted graphs assign values to edges. Complete graphs have edges between all vertex pairs.

## Graph Properties

The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it. A path is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph is connected if there's a path between any two vertices.

## Famous Problems

The Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, solved by Euler in 1736, asked if one could walk through the city crossing each bridge exactly once. Euler proved it impossible, founding graph theory.

## Applications

Graph theory is used in computer networks, social network analysis, transportation planning, circuit design, and many other fields. Algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and PageRank rely on graph theory.
