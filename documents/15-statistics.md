# Statistics and Probability

Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. Probability theory provides the mathematical foundation for statistics.

## Descriptive Statistics

Measures of central tendency include mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value). Measures of dispersion include range, variance, and standard deviation. The standard deviation σ measures how spread out values are from the mean.

## Probability

Probability quantifies the likelihood of events. For an event A, P(A) ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes equals 1.

## Distributions

The normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve fundamental to statistics. Many natural phenomena follow this distribution. The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.
